# update-tools

Bored by updating kubectx, helm, helmfile, stern, starship and similar utilities?

This repository contains a set of utilities to update each of the mentioned binaries.

At the moment, there is just a script to update helmfile, but more scripts will be added as soon as there are new releases.

## How to use

Just copy wished utility to some of the directories in your $PATH (i.e. /usr/local/bin) and run it.

All binaries will be downloaded to /usr/local/bin.
